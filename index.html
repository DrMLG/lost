    <p; span style="color: #ffffff;">Most fear those from hell, how do you know you’re not best friends with someone who is a demon. Most think they’ll look nothing like humans, but that’s not true…</p>
    <p>“Today is… September 29th, 2024.” Lost says. “Yes, it is. Why are you telling me this?” Her friend says. “I’m not talking to you. I’m reading the calendar” Lost says. She proceeds to put on her black trench coat. “So, Rosa, what were your plans.” Lost says. Lost’s friend, Rosa, looks at Lost, seeing Lost’s face in a mirror. “What’s with that purple on your face, and the eyepatch. What’s up with that?” Rosa asks. Lost stares at herself in the mirror. “You’ll find out some day” Lost says, then leaves. She walks outside, leaving her apartment. Lost pulls out a notepad with names on it and looks. She sighs “Okay, Nathan…” she mutters, then sighs again. “Good thing I have good handwriting…” She mutters and turns a corner.</p>
   <p>Lost isn’t human, she’s exactly what most fear, a demon. 3,000 years old and been watching the world since the dawn of recorded time, deciding everyone’s fate. If their fate doesn’t come as planned, she comes once a year to bring fate into her own hands.This was her time. She has a list of people to kill, but this time it’s different. One person she encountered became her friend. She doesn’t need to kill them, nor does she want to. Anyways…</p>
<p>Lost looks for her target, people staring at her from her choice in clothing. A black trench coat is stereotyped with horrible crimes. Especially after a tragedy that year, they were stigmatized. She finds and begins tailing her target, checking her coat for weapons and ammunition. Lost follows the man into a store, into the back, where he finally notices and turns around, stabbing Lost in the stomach. Lost grabs his arm. “Doth can’t kill what shalt not live” Lost says, pulling a sawed-off barrel double barrel shotgun. “Now, let’s stay calm here. If you move, you will lack a brain and skull.” Lost says, then looks the man in the eyes. “Is your first name Nathan?” She asks. The man stares, horrified. “Yes,” he says. “What is your last name?” Lost asks. “Videt” He says, still horrified. “Thanks, I always mess up my handwriting.” Lost says and shoots, the pellets from her shotgun striking Nathan’s head, killing him.</p>
      <p>Lost walks down the street, looking around, she looks in front of her and sees a familiar outfit. Someone she recognized, not a target, but someone from Hell. Lost’s mind races, she’s the only one who's supposed to be on Earth, why is this person here too? Lost keeps trailing them to a house, then walks around back and jumps inside through an open window. Lost wanders until finding the fellow demon. “Hello, Anta” Lost says, walking downstairs into the basement of the house. The demon, Anta, looks at Lost. “Who?” Anta says, lying through his teeth. “You know who I am...” Lost reaches into her trench coat, pulling out her shotgun “...And what you’ve done” She says. Anta stands up and pulls out his sword. “Oh yeah, what am I thinking” Lost says and takes a different, unhuman, pistol. Lost aims it at Anta’s head. “This scar’s been with me for 1,400 years, what’d I do to you?” She says. Anta stares down the barrel of her gun. “You were in my way,” Anta says. “Yeah? Well I collect swords of those who die, and you’re in mine.” She says, then shoots Anta. She grabs Anta’s sword from his dead hands and the sheath from his waist. She steals his firearms and calls Rosa. “Hey, I’m gonna need a ride home.”</p>
      <h1>angels on earth</h1>
      <p>“Ska… Rosa what are you talking about?” Lost says confused. “It’s a kind of music, it’s got like, brass… and… uh… guitars…” Rosa answers, stammering. “Look I don’t know what you’re talking about, can you play some ‘ska’ for me?” Lost requests, looking at the CD player. Rosa nods and puts in a CD for “Can’t Complain” and it starts playing. Lost listens to the ringing as it begins to start playing music. “So how in Hell would an angel like this?” Lost says and looks at Rosa. “Wouldn’t it be ‘How in Heaven would an angel like this’?” Rosa corrects. Lost stares at Rosa “Swear to god I’m gonna punch you in the face” She says. Rosa backs up “Uh, uhm… yeah I don’t know how an angel likes this, we should get going” Rosa says. Lost walks out the door and Rosa follows. She gets in the car and Rosa gets in the passenger seat. Lost begins driving and Rosa starts playing “You Were There” in the CD player. Lost stops at a club. “Are you sure this place is open in the middle of the day?” Lost says. “It should be, I see Deznev in there,” Rosa says and points at a boy on the stage. “Who?” Lost says and Rosa gets out of the car and walks inside. Lost gets out of the car and follows.</p>
      <p>Rosa starts talking to the boy on stage and Lost walks over. “Y-Yeah, w-w-we play ska music, we still haven’t made an a-album.” The boy says, stuttering, then looks at Lost. “How do you have that scar and seem worried when a demon walks in?” Lost says. “Huh? Uhm. I… Hello” The boy says and Rosa looks at Lost “That’s Deznev, just call him Dez,” Rosa says and points at the boy, Deznev. Dez backs up and walks into a wall “Ow…” He says and Lost climbs on stage. “Jeez you’re rude… Can you answer my question?” Lost says angrily. Dez looks at Lost “I’m not a demon like you, I’m an angel. I have demon friends… friend… but you look scary!” Dez says panicked. Lost looks over and sees a bass guitar, walks over to it, picks it up, and starts playing. “Do you have a bass player?” Lost says. Dez shakes his head no and Lost says “What’s your loser band name?” Dez looks At Lost “Uh… we just kinda play” Dez says. “Count me in” Lost says and stops playing. “When the hell do people-” Lost says and Dez cuts her off “N-No saying hell!” Lost looks at Dez “When do people get here?” Lost says. “Like an hour,” Rosa says, then she starts walking in circles.</p>
<p>The audience cheers and Dez tries to talk, but he stammers. Lost looks over and thinks, comes up with a band name, and a song to play. “We are Quake and this is Knowledge by Operation Ivy!” Lost yells and Dez jolts up, then starts chugging on his guitar. “I know! Things are gettin’ tougher when you can’t get the top of the barrel! The wide open road to my future is lookin’ narrow!” Dez sings and starts playing. Lost begins playing bass and throws her head around a bit. Lost sings along with Dez happily. They finish the song and Dez looks over at Lost, then walks off stage. Lost puts the bass down and follows Dez. The drummer follows too. Dez walks into an alleyway and leans on the wall. “You okay, Dez?” Lost asks. The drummer walks outside and Dez sees him, then smiles slightly. “Hi Sour,” Dez says. The drummer, Sour, looks at Dez and kisses his cheek. Dez laughs, thinking its a joke. Lost looks at Dez then walks back inside, Rosa waiting in front of the door. “Dude, I swear, Sour and Dez are totally dating,” Rosa says and Lost stares at her. “You make me wanna smoke 12 packs of cigarettes”</p>
          <p>Lost drives the car, listening to Operation Ivy. Rosa looks over at Lost “Dontcha wish we were like Dez and Sour?” Rosa says. “Dez thinks Sour is joking, idiot” Lost says. Rosa looks down then out the window. “You’re so negative…” Rosa says. “I’m aware, aren’t you 22? How on Earth do you act like this?” Lost says.</p>
