    <p; span style="color: #ffffff;">Most fear those from hell, how do you know you’re not best friends with someone who is a demon. Most think they’ll look nothing like humans, but that’s not true…</p>
    <p>“Today is… September 29th, 2024.” Lost says. “Yes, it is. Why are you telling me this?” Her friend says. “I’m not talking to you. I’m reading the calendar” Lost says. She proceeds to put on her black trench coat. “So, Rosa, what were your plans.” Lost says. Lost’s friend, Rosa, looks at Lost, seeing Lost’s face in a mirror. “What’s with that purple on your face, and the eyepatch. What’s up with that?” Rosa asks. Lost stares at herself in the mirror. “You’ll find out some day” Lost says, then leaves. She walks outside, leaving her apartment. Lost pulls out a notepad with names on it and looks. She sighs “Okay, Nathan…” she mutters, then sighs again. “Good thing I have good handwriting…” She mutters and turns a corner.</p>
   <p>Lost isn’t human, she’s exactly what most fear, a demon. 3,000 years old and been watching the world since the dawn of recorded time, deciding everyone’s fate. If their fate doesn’t come as planned, she comes once a year to bring fate into her own hands.This was her time. She has a list of people to kill, but this time it’s different. One person she encountered became her friend. She doesn’t need to kill them, nor does she want to. Anyways…</p>
<p>Lost looks for her target, people staring at her from her choice in clothing. A black trench coat is stereotyped with horrible crimes. Especially after a tragedy that year, they were stigmatized. She finds and begins tailing her target, checking her coat for weapons and ammunition. Lost follows the man into a store, into the back, where he finally notices and turns around, stabbing Lost in the stomach. Lost grabs his arm. “Doth can’t kill what shalt not live” Lost says, pulling a sawed-off barrel double barrel shotgun. “Now, let’s stay calm here. If you move, you will lack a brain and skull.” Lost says, then looks the man in the eyes. “Is your first name Nathan?” She asks. The man stares, horrified. “Yes,” he says. “What is your last name?” Lost asks. “Videt” He says, still horrified. “Thanks, I always mess up my handwriting.” Lost says and shoots, the pellets from her shotgun striking Nathan’s head, killing him.</p>
      <p>Lost walks down the street, looking around, she looks in front of her and sees a familiar outfit. Someone she recognized, not a target, but someone from Hell. Lost’s mind races, she’s the only one who's supposed to be on Earth, why is this person here too? Lost keeps trailing them to a house, then walks around back and jumps inside through an open window. Lost wanders until finding the fellow demon. “Hello, Anta” Lost says, walking downstairs into the basement of the house. The demon, Anta, looks at Lost. “Who?” Anta says, lying through his teeth. “You know who I am...” Lost reaches into her trench coat, pulling out her shotgun “...And what you’ve done” She says. Anta stands up and pulls out his sword. “Oh yeah, what am I thinking” Lost says and takes a different, unhuman, pistol. Lost aims it at Anta’s head. “This scar’s been with me for 1,400 years, what’d I do to you?” She says. Anta stares down the barrel of her gun. “You were in my way,” Anta says. “Yeah? Well I collect swords of those who die, and you’re in mine.” She says, then shoots Anta. She grabs Anta’s sword from his dead hands and the sheath from his waist. She steals his firearms and calls Rosa. “Hey, I’m gonna need a ride home.”</p>
      <h1>angels on earth</h1>
      <p>“Ska… Rosa what are you talking about?” Lost says confused. “It’s a kind of music, it’s got like, brass… and… uh… guitars…” Rosa answers, stammering. “Look I don’t know what you’re talking about, can you play some ‘ska’ for me?” Lost requests, looking at the CD player. Rosa nods and puts in a CD for “Can’t Complain” and it starts playing. Lost listens to the ringing as it begins to start playing music. “So how in Hell would an angel like this?” Lost says and looks at Rosa. “Wouldn’t it be ‘How in Heaven would an angel like this’?” Rosa corrects. Lost stares at Rosa “Swear to god I’m gonna punch you in the face” She says. Rosa backs up “Uh, uhm… yeah I don’t know how an angel likes this, we should get going” Rosa says. Lost walks out the door and Rosa follows. She gets in the car and Rosa gets in the passenger seat. Lost begins driving and Rosa starts playing “You Were There” in the CD player. Lost stops at a club. “Are you sure this place is open in the middle of the day?” Lost says. “It should be, I see Deznev in there,” Rosa says and points at a boy on the stage. “Who?” Lost says and Rosa gets out of the car and walks inside. Lost gets out of the car and follows.</p>
      <p>Rosa starts talking to the boy on stage and Lost walks over. “Y-Yeah, w-w-we play ska music, we still haven’t made an a-album.” The boy says, stuttering, then looks at Lost. “How do you have that scar and seem worried when a demon walks in?” Lost says. “Huh? Uhm. I… Hello” The boy says and Rosa looks at Lost “That’s Deznev, just call him Dez,” Rosa says and points at the boy, Deznev. Dez backs up and walks into a wall “Ow…” He says and Lost climbs on stage. “Jeez you’re rude… Can you answer my question?” Lost says angrily. Dez looks at Lost “I’m not a demon like you, I’m an angel. I have demon friends… friend… but you look scary!” Dez says panicked. Lost looks over and sees a bass guitar, walks over to it, picks it up, and starts playing. “Do you have a bass player?” Lost says. Dez shakes his head no and Lost says “What’s your loser band name?” Dez looks At Lost “Uh… we just kinda play” Dez says. “Count me in” Lost says and stops playing. “When the hell do people-” Lost says and Dez cuts her off “N-No saying hell!” Lost looks at Dez “When do people get here?” Lost says. “Like an hour,” Rosa says, then she starts walking in circles.</p>
<p>The audience cheers and Dez tries to talk, but he stammers. Lost looks over and thinks, comes up with a band name, and a song to play. “We are Quake and this is Knowledge by Operation Ivy!” Lost yells and Dez jolts up, then starts chugging on his guitar. “I know! Things are gettin’ tougher when you can’t get the top of the barrel! The wide open road to my future is lookin’ narrow!” Dez sings and starts playing. Lost begins playing bass and throws her head around a bit. Lost sings along with Dez happily. They finish the song and Dez looks over at Lost, then walks off stage. Lost puts the bass down and follows Dez. The drummer follows too. Dez walks into an alleyway and leans on the wall. “You okay, Dez?” Lost asks. The drummer walks outside and Dez sees him, then smiles slightly. “Hi Sour,” Dez says. The drummer, Sour, looks at Dez and kisses his cheek. Dez laughs, thinking its a joke. Lost looks at Dez then walks back inside, Rosa waiting in front of the door. “Dude, I swear, Sour and Dez are totally dating,” Rosa says and Lost stares at her. “You make me wanna smoke 12 packs of cigarettes”</p>
          <p>Lost drives the car, listening to Operation Ivy. Rosa looks over at Lost “Dontcha wish we were like Dez and Sour?” Rosa says. “Dez thinks Sour is joking, idiot” Lost says. Rosa looks down then out the window. “You’re so negative…” Rosa says. “I’m aware, aren’t you 22? How on Earth do you act like this?” Lost says.</p>
          <h1>1,400 years</h1>
          <p>“Time and space work the same everywhere, 1,400 years ago I got this scar. I was cut in the face with a sword.” Lost says, then touches her scar. “I am probably just as confused as you are as how it turned into this purple… thing, same time, I can’t explain half the stuff going on” Lost says. “It looks like a purple blob” Rosa says and pokes it, burning her finger. “Ow! Jeez, why’s it so hot?!” Rosa exclaims and Lost looks at her finger. “Dunno, a human has never touched it,” Lost says, then begins laughing. “Wait! Imagine if some angel touched it, it would take their whole hand off probably!” Lost says, trying to catch her breath. “Let’s go see what happens if Dez touches it” Rosa says and walks outside, Lost following.</p>
          <p>Lost begins driving and Rosa tells her directions to Deznev’s house.  Lost keeps driving when someone crashes into them, flipping the car on its side. Lost unbuckles her seatbelt and gets Rosa out of the car, then herself. Lost looks for the driver that hit her and finds who. She sees Anta, the person who hit her. “I swear I… I shot you” Lost says and Anta turns around, trying to shoot her with a normal gun. The bullet strikes her shoulder and passes right through, creating a whole that black liquid drips out of it. Lost falls to the ground and begins crying. Lost’s trench coat turns red, her eye turns fully white and glows. She gets up and takes her eyepatch off, revealing a black hole in her head. A sword appears in her hand, a long sword with crystals floating all around it. Anta takes out his own sword, a much smaller sword, it’s on fire. Anta walks closer to Lost and swings at Lost. Lost blocks it with her own sword and slightly strikes Anta’s shoulder, cutting the sleeve of his shirt and revealing his own scar. Black crystals in his shoulder, giving Lost more incentive to kill him to take the crystals. “It was you!” Lost yells, trying to cut Anta’s arm off. All she does is strike the crystals and Anta dashes away, too fast for Lost, and she knows that, so she goes back to Rosa.</p>
          <p>Police show up and arrest Lost and take Rosa away. They take her to the police station and into an interrogation room. They cuff her to the table and a cop sits in front of her. “So what were you doing with a… sword?!” The cop says in disbelief. Lost just stares at him. The officer repeats himself and Lost tilts her head. “Do you have any guesses?” Lost says and the cop slams his hand on the table, the officer yells “I’m not playing no guessing games!” Lost looks at him “Do you like… hm… Kill Lincoln?” Lost puts emphasis on her words. The cop takes his gun out and sets it on the table. “Wow. Okay John Mcclane. So you’re gonna shoot me?” Lost says and looks at his gun. “I was sword fighting with the guy who hit my car. Now I’d recommend letting me go” Lost says ominously. The officer puts his gun away and uncuffs lost, slightly panicked.</p>
          <p>Lost walks inside and yells “Rosa?” Rosa walks out of her room, looking mostly unharmed from the crash. “Ah, good to know you’re alive.” Lost says and walks to her room. “Why were you at a police station?” Rosa asks. “You’ll find out eventually.” Lost says and looks through her safe. “Tonight I play with Dez’s band, right?” She asks Rosa. “Huh? Oh, yeah” Rosa answers and Lost closes her safe, leaving her room and the house. She gets in the car and starts driving, leaving Rosa without her car. Lost gets to the band, jumps up on stage, and grabs her bass. “People coming at the same time?” Lost asks. Dez looks at her “Huh? Oh, yeah. Listen to this I learned a new song” Dez says and begins playing his guitar, mumbling the frets he’s playing “5-3-3, 1-3-3, 8-10-10, 8-10-10.” Lost looks at Dez and points at him “Oh! Scott Pilgrim VS The World Ruined A Generation Of Women by NegativeXP!” Lost yells. Dez looks at Lost confused, not actually knowing what song he’s playing. “Sour is that the song?” Dez says and looks back at Sour, who's hanging over his drums, laughing extremely hard. “Y-Y-Yeah! That’s it!” Sour yells, stuttering and laughing. “That’s not a very nice song name,” Dez says, slightly angry. “Yeah? Cry about it, the song’s hilarious,” Lost says and begins playing the bass riff to Clark Gable.</p>
          <p>People gather around the stage waiting for Lost, Dez, and Sour to start playing. “What song are we gonna open with?” Dez asks, panicked. “Y’know the drums to the song you taught him?” Lost asks sour and he nods his head yes. “Looks like we got a song to play, Dez,” Lost says and walks up on stage, Dez and Sour following. Dez picks up his guitar and Sour gets on the drums. “We are Quake and this is Scott Pilgrim VS The World Ruined A Generation Of Women originally by NegativeXP!” Lost says and plays the opening to the song, Dez getting ready to play the guitar. Dez, Sour, and Lost play the song the whole way through and the crowd loves it.</p>
          <p>Dez, Lost, and Sour keep playing and after walk off stage. Dez looks at Lost and sour slightly angrily. “The song we opened with is rude” He said bitterly. “Man it’s funny, it’s also 21 years out of date,” Lost says, stretching her arms. Sour looks at Dez “You said you wanted to start a ska band, I know a guy who plays a ton of brass instruments, he’s like… an enthusiast of brass,” Sour says and Dez looks over at him. “Really?” Dez says excited. “Uhhhh… Yeah. Dude’s driving me home so we can go talk to him” Sour says and Dez nods his head. Sour walks out the door into the alley and walks to the street, walking up to a black sports car. He knocks on the window and the man inside rolls it down, he had glasses and light brown hair with an Operation Ivy shirt on. Lost instantly recognizes the shirt. “Nice shirt,” Lost says and the man looks at his shirt “Huh? Oh, thanks. What’s up, Sour?” The man says and asks. “So this is my band, you still play trumpet and trombone and y’know… that funny one… uhhhhh…” Sour says and begins stammering. “...Saxophone?” The man asks and Sour stops stammering “Yeah, saxophone.” The man looks at the three of them. “Yeah, do you want me to join or something?” The man says and Sour nods his head. “Cool, looks like I’m in Quake now, I’m Yuri.” Yuri says. “Cool” Sour says and gets in the passenger seat. Lost walks inside before Sour can say anything and Dez follows.</p>
