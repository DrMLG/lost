    <p; span style="color: #ffffff;">Most fear those from hell, how do you know you’re not best friends with someone who is a demon. Most think they’ll look nothing like humans, but that’s not true…</p>
    <p>“Today is… September 29th, 2024.” Lost says. “Yes, it is. Why are you telling me this?” Her friend says. “I’m not talking to you. I’m reading the calendar” Lost says. She proceeds to put on her black trench coat. “So, Rosa, what were your plans.” Lost says. Lost’s friend, Rosa, looks at Lost, seeing Lost’s face in a mirror. “What’s with that purple on your face, and the eyepatch. What’s up with that?” Rosa asks. Lost stares at herself in the mirror. “You’ll find out some day” Lost says, then leaves. She walks outside, leaving her apartment. Lost pulls out a notepad with names on it and looks. She sighs “Okay, Nathan…” she mutters, then sighs again. “Good thing I have good handwriting…” She mutters and turns a corner.</p>
   <p>Lost isn’t human, she’s exactly what most fear, a demon. 3,000 years old and been watching the world since the dawn of recorded time, deciding everyone’s fate. If their fate doesn’t come as planned, she comes once a year to bring fate into her own hands.This was her time. She has a list of people to kill, but this time it’s different. One person she encountered became her friend. She doesn’t need to kill them, nor does she want to. Anyways…</p>
<p>Lost looks for her target, people staring at her from her choice in clothing. A black trench coat is stereotyped with horrible crimes. Especially after a tragedy that year, they were stigmatized. She finds and begins tailing her target, checking her coat for weapons and ammunition. Lost follows the man into a store, into the back, where he finally notices and turns around, stabbing Lost in the stomach. Lost grabs his arm. “Doth can’t kill what shalt not live” Lost says, pulling a sawed-off barrel double barrel shotgun. “Now, let’s stay calm here. If you move, you will lack a brain and skull.” Lost says, then looks the man in the eyes. “Is your first name Nathan?” She asks. The man stares, horrified. “Yes,” he says. “What is your last name?” Lost asks. “Videt” He says, still horrified. “Thanks, I always mess up my handwriting.” Lost says and shoots, the pellets from her shotgun striking Nathan’s head, killing him.</p>
      <p>Lost walks down the street, looking around, she looks in front of her and sees a familiar outfit. Someone she recognized, not a target, but someone from Hell. Lost’s mind races, she’s the only one who's supposed to be on Earth, why is this person here too? Lost keeps trailing them to a house, then walks around back and jumps inside through an open window. Lost wanders until finding the fellow demon. “Hello, Anta” Lost says, walking downstairs into the basement of the house. The demon, Anta, looks at Lost. “Who?” Anta says, lying through his teeth. “You know who I am...” Lost reaches into her trench coat, pulling out her shotgun “...And what you’ve done” She says. Anta stands up and pulls out his sword. “Oh yeah, what am I thinking” Lost says and takes a different, unhuman, pistol. Lost aims it at Anta’s head. “This scar’s been with me for 1,400 years, what’d I do to you?” She says. Anta stares down the barrel of her gun. “You were in my way,” Anta says. “Yeah? Well I collect swords of those who die, and you’re in mine.” She says, then shoots Anta. She grabs Anta’s sword from his dead hands and the sheath from his waist. She steals his firearms and calls Rosa. “Hey, I’m gonna need a ride home.”</p>
