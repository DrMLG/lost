    <p>“Today is… September 29th, 2024.” Lost says. “Yes, it is. Why are you telling me this?” Her friend says. “I’m not talking to you. I’m reading the calendar” Lost says. She proceeds to put on her black trench coat. “So, Rosa, what were your plans.” Lost says. Lost’s friend, Rosa, looks at Lost, seeing Lost’s face in a mirror. “What’s with that purple on your face, and the eyepatch. What’s up with that?” Rosa asks. Lost stares at herself in the mirror. “You’ll find out some day” Lost says, then leaves. She walks outside, leaving her apartment. Lost pulls out a notepad with names on it and looks. She sighs “Okay, Nathan…” she mutters, then sighs again. “Good thing I have good handwriting…” She mutters and turns a corner.</p>
